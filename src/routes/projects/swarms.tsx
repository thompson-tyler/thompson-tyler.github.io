    <p>
      I have a weird obsession with swarm intelligence. I've built a few C++
      programs which simulate the swarm movement of birds and ants using some
      algorithms I found online. The ant algorithm was particularly tricky and I
      definitely took a more DIY approach with it, consulting the internet as
      little as possible.
